	Value "80.0" invalid for option p (number expected)
	NAME
	    rsem-calculate-expression
	
	SYNOPSIS
	     rsem-calculate-expression [options] upstream_read_file(s) reference_name sample_name 
	     rsem-calculate-expression [options] --paired-end upstream_read_file(s) downstream_read_file(s) reference_name sample_name 
	     rsem-calculate-expression [options] --sam/--bam [--paired-end] input reference_name sample_name
	
	ARGUMENTS
	    upstream_read_files(s)
	        Comma-separated list of files containing single-end reads or
	        upstream reads for paired-end data. By default, these files are
	        assumed to be in FASTQ format. If the --no-qualities option is
	        specified, then FASTA format is expected.
	
	    downstream_read_file(s)
	        Comma-separated list of files containing downstream reads which are
	        paired with the upstream reads. By default, these files are assumed
	        to be in FASTQ format. If the --no-qualities option is specified,
	        then FASTA format is expected.
	
	    input
	        SAM/BAM formatted input file. If "-" is specified for the filename,
	        SAM/BAM input is instead assumed to come from standard input. RSEM
	        requires all alignments of the same read group together. For
	        paired-end reads, RSEM also requires the two mates of any alignment
	        be adjacent. See Description section for how to make input file obey
	        RSEM's requirements.
	
	    reference_name
	        The name of the reference used. The user must have run
	        'rsem-prepare-reference' with this reference_name before running
	        this program.
	
	    sample_name
	        The name of the sample analyzed. All output files are prefixed by
	        this name (e.g., sample_name.genes.results)
	
	BASIC OPTIONS
	    --paired-end
	        Input reads are paired-end reads. (Default: off)
	
	    --no-qualities
	        Input reads do not contain quality scores. (Default: off)
	
	    --strand-specific
	        The RNA-Seq protocol used to generate the reads is strand specific,
	        i.e., all (upstream) reads are derived from the forward strand. This
	        option is equivalent to --forward-prob=1.0. With this option set, if
	        RSEM runs the Bowtie/Bowtie 2 aligner, the '--norc' Bowtie/Bowtie 2
	        option will be used, which disables alignment to the reverse strand
	        of transcripts. (Default: off)
	
	    --bowtie2
	        Use Bowtie 2 instead of Bowtie to align reads. Since currently RSEM
	        does not handle indel, local and discordant alignments, the Bowtie2
	        parameters are set in a way to avoid those alignments. In
	        particular, we use options '--sensitive --dpad 0 --gbar 99999999
	        --mp 1,1 --np 1 --score-min L,0,-0.1' by default. The last parameter
	        of '--score-min', '-0.1', is the negative of maximum mismatch rate.
	        This rate can be set by option '--bowtie2-mismatch-rate'. If reads
	        are paired-end, we additionally use options '--no-mixed' and
	        '--no-discordant'. (Default: off)
	
	    --sam
	        Input file is in SAM format. (Default: off)
	
	    --bam
	        Input file is in BAM format. (Default: off)
	
	    -p/--num-threads <int>
	        Number of threads to use. Both Bowtie/Bowtie2, expression estimation
	        and 'samtools sort' will use this many threads. (Default: 1)
	
	    --no-bam-output
	        Do not output any BAM file. (Default: off)
	
	    --output-genome-bam
	        Generate a BAM file, 'sample_name.genome.bam', with alignments
	        mapped to genomic coordinates and annotated with their posterior
	        probabilities. In addition, RSEM will call samtools (included in
	        RSEM package) to sort and index the bam file.
	        'sample_name.genome.sorted.bam' and
	        'sample_name.genome.sorted.bam.bai' will be generated. (Default:
	        off)
	
	    --sampling-for-bam
	        When RSEM generates a BAM file, instead of outputing all alignments
	        a read has with their posterior probabilities, one alignment is
	        sampled according to the posterior probabilities. The sampling
	        procedure includes the alignment to the "noise" transcript, which
	        does not appear in the BAM file. Only the sampled alignment has a
	        weight of 1. All other alignments have weight 0. If the "noise"
	        transcript is sampled, all alignments appeared in the BAM file
	        should have weight 0. (Default: off)
	
	    --seed <uint32>
	        Set the seed for the random number generators used in calculating
	        posterior mean estimates and credibility intervals. The seed must be
	        a non-negative 32 bit interger. (Default: off)
	
	    --calc-pme
	        Run RSEM's collapsed Gibbs sampler to calculate posterior mean
	        estimates. (Default: off)
	
	    --calc-ci
	        Calculate 95% credibility intervals and posterior mean estimates.
	        The credibility level can be changed by setting
	        '--ci-credibility-level'. (Default: off)
	
	    -q/--quiet
	        Suppress the output of logging information. (Default: off)
	
	    -h/--help
	        Show help information.
	
	    --version
	        Show version information.
	
	ADVANCED OPTIONS
	    --sam-header-info <file>
	        RSEM reads header information from input by default. If this option
	        is on, header information is read from the specified file. For the
	        format of the file, please see SAM official website. (Default: "")
	
	    --seed-length <int>
	        Seed length used by the read aligner. Providing the correct value is
	        important for RSEM. If RSEM runs Bowtie, it uses this value for
	        Bowtie's seed length parameter. Any read with its or at least one of
	        its mates' (for paired-end reads) length less than this value will
	        be ignored. If the references are not added poly(A) tails, the
	        minimum allowed value is 5, otherwise, the minimum allowed value is
	        25. Note that this script will only check if the value >= 5 and give
	        a warning message if the value < 25 but >= 5. (Default: 25)
	
	    --tag <string>
	        The name of the optional field used in the SAM input for identifying
	        a read with too many valid alignments. The field should have the
	        format <tagName>:i:<value>, where a <value> bigger than 0 indicates
	        a read with too many alignments. (Default: "")
	
	    --bowtie-path <path>
	        The path to the Bowtie executables. (Default: the path to the Bowtie
	        executables is assumed to be in the user's PATH environment
	        variable)
	
	    --bowtie-n <int>
	        (Bowtie parameter) max # of mismatches in the seed. (Range: 0-3,
	        Default: 2)
	
	    --bowtie-e <int>
	        (Bowtie parameter) max sum of mismatch quality scores across the
	        alignment. (Default: 99999999)
	
	    --bowtie-m <int>
	        (Bowtie parameter) suppress all alignments for a read if > <int>
	        valid alignments exist. (Default: 200)
	
	    --bowtie-chunkmbs <int>
	        (Bowtie parameter) memory allocated for best first alignment
	        calculation (Default: 0 - use Bowtie's default)
	
	    --phred33-quals
	        Input quality scores are encoded as Phred+33. (Default: on)
	
	    --phred64-quals
	        Input quality scores are encoded as Phred+64 (default for GA
	        Pipeline ver. >= 1.3). (Default: off)
	
	    --solexa-quals
	        Input quality scores are solexa encoded (from GA Pipeline ver. <
	        1.3). (Default: off)
	
	    --bowtie2-path <path>
	        (Bowtie 2 parameter) The path to the Bowtie 2 executables. (Default:
	        the path to the Bowtie 2 executables is assumed to be in the user's
	        PATH environment variable)
	
	    --bowtie2-mismatch-rate <double>
	        (Bowtie 2 parameter) The maximum mismatch rate allowed. (Default:
	        0.1)
	
	    --bowtie2-k <int>
	        (Bowtie 2 parameter) Find up to <int> alignments per read. (Default:
	        200)
	
	    --bowtie2-sensitivity-level <string>
	        (Bowtie 2 parameter) Set Bowtie 2's preset options in --end-to-end
	        mode. This option controls how hard Bowtie 2 tries to find
	        alignments. <string> must be one of "very_fast", "fast", "sensitive"
	        and "very_sensitive". The four candidates correspond to Bowtie 2's
	        "--very-fast", "--fast", "--sensitive" and "--very-sensitive"
	        options. (Default: "sensitive" - use Bowtie 2's default)
	
	    --forward-prob <double>
	        Probability of generating a read from the forward strand of a
	        transcript. Set to 1 for a strand-specific protocol where all
	        (upstream) reads are derived from the forward strand, 0 for a
	        strand-specific protocol where all (upstream) read are derived from
	        the reverse strand, or 0.5 for a non-strand-specific protocol.
	        (Default: 0.5)
	
	    --fragment-length-min <int>
	        Minimum read/insert length allowed. This is also the value for the
	        Bowtie/Bowtie2 -I option. (Default: 1)
	
	    --fragment-length-max <int>
	        Maximum read/insert length allowed. This is also the value for the
	        Bowtie/Bowtie 2 -X option. (Default: 1000)
	
	    --fragment-length-mean <double>
	        (single-end data only) The mean of the fragment length distribution,
	        which is assumed to be a Gaussian. (Default: -1, which disables use
	        of the fragment length distribution)
	
	    --fragment-length-sd <double>
	        (single-end data only) The standard deviation of the fragment length
	        distribution, which is assumed to be a Gaussian. (Default: 0, which
	        assumes that all fragments are of the same length, given by the
	        rounded value of --fragment-length-mean)
	
	    --estimate-rspd
	        Set this option if you want to estimate the read start position
	        distribution (RSPD) from data. Otherwise, RSEM will use a uniform
	        RSPD. (Default: off)
	
	    --num-rspd-bins <int>
	        Number of bins in the RSPD. Only relevant when '--estimate-rspd' is
	        specified. Use of the default setting is recommended. (Default: 20)
	
	    --gibbs-burnin <int>
	        The number of burn-in rounds for RSEM's Gibbs sampler. Each round
	        passes over the entire data set once. If RSEM can use multiple
	        threads, multiple Gibbs samplers will start at the same time and all
	        samplers share the same burn-in number. (Default: 200)
	
	    --gibbs-number-of-samples <int>
	        The total number of count vectors RSEM will collect from its Gibbs
	        samplers. (Default: 1000)
	
	    --gibbs-sampling-gap <int>
	        The number of rounds between two succinct count vectors RSEM
	        collects. If the count vector after round N is collected, the count
	        vector after round N + <int> will also be collected. (Default: 1)
	
	    --ci-credibility-level <double>
	        The credibility level for credibility intervals. (Default: 0.95)
	
	    --ci-memory <int>
	        Maximum size (in memory, MB) of the auxiliary buffer used for
	        computing credibility intervals (CI). Set it larger for a faster CI
	        calculation. However, leaving 2 GB memory free for other usage is
	        recommended. (Default: 1024)
	
	    --ci-number-of-samples-per-count-vector <int>
	        The number of read generating probability vectors sampled per
	        sampled count vector. The crebility intervals are calculated by
	        first sampling P(C | D) and then sampling P(Theta | C) for each
	        sampled count vector. This option controls how many Theta vectors
	        are sampled per sampled count vector. (Default: 50)
	
	    --samtools-sort-mem <string>
	        Set the maximum memory per thread that can be used by 'samtools
	        sort'. <string> represents the memory and accepts suffices 'K/M/G'.
	        RSEM will pass <string> to the '-m' option of 'samtools sort'.
	        Please note that the default used here is different from the default
	        used by samtools. (Default: 1G)
	
	    --keep-intermediate-files
	        Keep temporary files generated by RSEM. RSEM creates a temporary
	        directory, 'sample_name.temp', into which it puts all intermediate
	        output files. If this directory already exists, RSEM overwrites all
	        files generated by previous RSEM runs inside of it. By default,
	        after RSEM finishes, the temporary directory is deleted. Set this
	        option to prevent the deletion of this directory and the
	        intermediate files inside of it. (Default: off)
	
	    --temporary-folder <string>
	        Set where to put the temporary files generated by RSEM. If the
	        folder specified does not exist, RSEM will try to create it.
	        (Default: sample_name.temp)
	
	    --time
	        Output time consumed by each step of RSEM to 'sample_name.time'.
	        (Default: off)
	
	DESCRIPTION
	    In its default mode, this program aligns input reads against a reference
	    transcriptome with Bowtie and calculates expression values using the
	    alignments. RSEM assumes the data are single-end reads with quality
	    scores, unless the '--paired-end' or '--no-qualities' options are
	    specified. Users may use an alternative aligner by specifying one of the
	    --sam and --bam options, and providing an alignment file in the
	    specified format. However, users should make sure that they align
	    against the indices generated by 'rsem-prepare-reference' and the
	    alignment file satisfies the requirements mentioned in ARGUMENTS
	    section.
	
	    One simple way to make the alignment file satisfying RSEM's requirements
	    (assuming the aligner used put mates in a paired-end read adjacent) is
	    to use 'convert-sam-for-rsem' script. This script only accept SAM format
	    files as input. If a BAM format file is obtained, please use samtools to
	    convert it to a SAM file first. For example, if '/ref/mouse_125' is the
	    'reference_name' and the SAM file is named 'input.sam', you can run the
	    following command:
	
	      convert-sam-for-rsem /ref/mouse_125 input.sam -o input_for_rsem.sam
	
	    For details, please refer to 'convert-sam-for-rsem's documentation page.
	
	    The SAM/BAM format RSEM uses is v1.4. However, it is compatible with old
	    SAM/BAM format. However, RSEM cannot recognize 0x100 in the FLAG field.
	    In addition, RSEM requires SEQ and QUAL are not '*'.
	
	    The user must run 'rsem-prepare-reference' with the appropriate
	    reference before using this program.
	
	    For single-end data, it is strongly recommended that the user provide
	    the fragment length distribution parameters (--fragment-length-mean and
	    --fragment-length-sd). For paired-end data, RSEM will automatically
	    learn a fragment length distribution from the data.
	
	    Please note that some of the default values for the Bowtie parameters
	    are not the same as those defined for Bowtie itself.
	
	    The temporary directory and all intermediate files will be removed when
	    RSEM finishes unless '--keep-intermediate-files' is specified.
	
	    With the '--calc-pme' option, posterior mean estimates will be
	    calculated in addition to maximum likelihood estimates.
	
	    With the '--calc-ci' option, 95% credibility intervals and posterior
	    mean estimates will be calculated in addition to maximum likelihood
	    estimates.
	
	OUTPUT
	    sample_name.isoforms.results
	        File containing isoform level expression estimates. The first line
	        contains column names separated by the tab character. The format of
	        each line in the rest of this file is:
	
	        transcript_id gene_id length effective_length expected_count TPM
	        FPKM IsoPct [posterior_mean_count
	        posterior_standard_deviation_of_count pme_TPM pme_FPKM
	        IsoPct_from_pme_TPM TPM_ci_lower_bound TPM_ci_upper_bound
	        FPKM_ci_lower_bound FPKM_ci_upper_bound]
	
	        Fields are separated by the tab character. Fields within "[]" are
	        optional. They will not be presented if neither '--calc-pme' nor
	        '--calc-ci' is set.
	
	        'transcript_id' is the transcript name of this transcript. 'gene_id'
	        is the gene name of the gene which this transcript belongs to
	        (denote this gene as its parent gene). If no gene information is
	        provided, 'gene_id' and 'transcript_id' are the same.
	
	        'length' is this transcript's sequence length (poly(A) tail is not
	        counted). 'effective_length' counts only the positions that can
	        generate a valid fragment. If no poly(A) tail is added,
	        'effective_length' is equal to transcript length - mean fragment
	        length + 1. If one transcript's effective length is less than 1,
	        this transcript's both effective length and abundance estimates are
	        set to 0.
	
	        'expected_count' is the sum of the posterior probability of each
	        read comes from this transcript over all reads. Because 1) each read
	        aligning to this transcript has a probability of being generated
	        from background noise; 2) RSEM may filter some alignable low quality
	        reads, the sum of expected counts for all transcript are generally
	        less than the total number of reads aligned.
	
	        'TPM' stands for Transcripts Per Million. It is a relative measure
	        of transcript abundance. The sum of all transcripts' TPM is 1
	        million. 'FPKM' stands for Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per
	        Million mapped reads. It is another relative measure of transcript
	        abundance. If we define l_bar be the mean transcript length in a
	        sample, which can be calculated as
	
	        l_bar = \sum_i TPM_i / 10^6 * effective_length_i (i goes through
	        every transcript),
	
	        the following equation is hold:
	
	        FPKM_i = 10^3 / l_bar * TPM_i.
	
	        We can see that the sum of FPKM is not a constant across samples.
	
	        'IsoPct' stands for isoform percentage. It is the percentage of this
	        transcript's abandunce over its parent gene's abandunce. If its
	        parent gene has only one isoform or the gene information is not
	        provided, this field will be set to 100.
	
	        'posterior_mean_count', 'pme_TPM', 'pme_FPKM' are posterior mean
	        estimates calculated by RSEM's Gibbs sampler.
	        'posterior_standard_deviation_of_count' is the posterior standard
	        deviation of counts. 'IsoPct_from_pme_TPM' is the isoform percentage
	        calculated from 'pme_TPM' values.
	
	        'TPM_ci_lower_bound', 'TPM_ci_upper_bound', 'FPKM_ci_lower_bound'
	        and 'FPKM_ci_upper_bound' are lower(l) and upper(u) bounds of 95%
	        credibility intervals for TPM and FPKM values. The bounds are
	        inclusive (i.e. [l, u]).
	
	    sample_name.genes.results
	        File containing gene level expression estimates. The first line
	        contains column names separated by the tab character. The format of
	        each line in the rest of this file is:
	
	        gene_id transcript_id(s) length effective_length expected_count TPM
	        FPKM [posterior_mean_count posterior_standard_deviation_of_count
	        pme_TPM pme_FPKM TPM_ci_lower_bound TPM_ci_upper_bound
	        FPKM_ci_lower_bound FPKM_ci_upper_bound]
	
	        Fields are separated by the tab character. Fields within "[]" are
	        optional. They will not be presented if neither '--calc-pme' nor
	        '--calc-ci' is set.
	
	        'transcript_id(s)' is a comma-separated list of transcript_ids
	        belonging to this gene. If no gene information is provided,
	        'gene_id' and 'transcript_id(s)' are identical (the
	        'transcript_id').
	
	        A gene's 'length' and 'effective_length' are defined as the weighted
	        average of its transcripts' lengths and effective lengths (weighted
	        by 'IsoPct'). A gene's abundance estimates are just the sum of its
	        transcripts' abundance estimates.
	
	    sample_name.alleles.results
	        Only generated when the RSEM references are built with
	        allele-specific transcripts.
	
	        This file contains allele level expression estimates for
	        allele-specific expression calculation. The first line contains
	        column names separated by the tab character. The format of each line
	        in the rest of this file is:
	
	        allele_id transcript_id gene_id length effective_length
	        expected_count TPM FPKM AlleleIsoPct AlleleGenePct
	        [posterior_mean_count posterior_standard_deviation_of_count pme_TPM
	        pme_FPKM AlleleIsoPct_from_pme_TPM AlleleGenePct_from_pme_TPM
	        TPM_ci_lower_bound TPM_ci_upper_bound FPKM_ci_lower_bound
	        FPKM_ci_upper_bound]
	
	        Fields are separated by the tab character. Fields within "[]" are
	        optional. They will not be presented if neither '--calc-pme' nor
	        '--calc-ci' is set.
	
	        'allele_id' is the allele-specific name of this allele-specific
	        transcript.
	
	        'AlleleIsoPct' stands for allele-specific percentage on isoform
	        level. It is the percentage of this allele-specific transcript's
	        abundance over its parent transcript's abundance. If its parent
	        transcript has only one allele variant form, this field will be set
	        to 100.
	
	        'AlleleGenePct' stands for allele-specific percentage on gene level.
	        It is the percentage of this allele-specific transcript's abundance
	        over its parent gene's abundance.
	
	        'AlleleIsoPct_from_pme_TPM' and 'AlleleGenePct_from_pme_TPM' have
	        similar meanings. They are calculated based on posterior mean
	        estimates.
	
	        Please note that if this file is present, the fields 'length' and
	        'effective_length' in 'sample_name.isoforms.results' should be
	        interpreted similarly as the corresponding definitions in
	        'sample_name.genes.results'.
	
	    sample_name.transcript.bam, sample_name.transcript.sorted.bam and
	    sample_name.transcript.sorted.bam.bai
	        Only generated when --no-bam-output is not specified.
	
	        'sample_name.transcript.bam' is a BAM-formatted file of read
	        alignments in transcript coordinates. The MAPQ field of each
	        alignment is set to min(100, floor(-10 * log10(1.0 - w) + 0.5)),
	        where w is the posterior probability of that alignment being the
	        true mapping of a read. In addition, RSEM pads a new tag ZW:f:value,
	        where value is a single precision floating number representing the
	        posterior probability. Because this file contains all alignment
	        lines produced by bowtie or user-specified aligners, it can also be
	        used as a replacement of the aligner generated BAM/SAM file. For
	        paired-end reads, if one mate has alignments but the other does not,
	        this file marks the alignable mate as "unmappable" (flag bit 0x4)
	        and appends an optional field "Z0:A:!".
	
	        'sample_name.transcript.sorted.bam' and
	        'sample_name.transcript.sorted.bam.bai' are the sorted BAM file and
	        indices generated by samtools (included in RSEM package).
	
	    sample_name.genome.bam, sample_name.genome.sorted.bam and
	    sample_name.genome.sorted.bam.bai
	        Only generated when --no-bam-output is not specified and
	        --output-genome-bam is specified.
	
	        'sample_name.genome.bam' is a BAM-formatted file of read alignments
	        in genomic coordinates. Alignments of reads that have identical
	        genomic coordinates (i.e., alignments to different isoforms that
	        share the same genomic region) are collapsed into one alignment. The
	        MAPQ field of each alignment is set to min(100, floor(-10 *
	        log10(1.0 - w) + 0.5)), where w is the posterior probability of that
	        alignment being the true mapping of a read. In addition, RSEM pads a
	        new tag ZW:f:value, where value is a single precision floating
	        number representing the posterior probability. If an alignment is
	        spliced, a XS:A:value tag is also added, where value is either '+'
	        or '-' indicating the strand of the transcript it aligns to.
	
	        'sample_name.genome.sorted.bam' and
	        'sample_name.genome.sorted.bam.bai' are the sorted BAM file and
	        indices generated by samtools (included in RSEM package).
	
	    sample_name.time
	        Only generated when --time is specified.
	
	        It contains time (in seconds) consumed by aligning reads, estimating
	        expression levels and calculating credibility intervals.
	
	    sample_name.stat
	        This is a folder instead of a file. All model related statistics are
	        stored in this folder. Use 'rsem-plot-model' can generate plots
	        using this folder.
	
	        'sample_name.stat/sample_name.cnt' contains alignment statistics.
	        The format and meanings of each field are described in
	        'cnt_file_description.txt' under RSEM directory.
	
	        'sample_name.stat/sample_name.model' stores RNA-Seq model parameters
	        learned from the data. The format and meanings of each filed of this
	        file are described in 'model_file_description.txt' under RSEM
	        directory.
	
	EXAMPLES
	    Assume the path to the bowtie executables is in the user's PATH
	    environment variable. Reference files are under '/ref' with name
	    'mouse_125'.
	
	    1) '/data/mmliver.fq', single-end reads with quality scores. Quality
	    scores are encoded as for 'GA pipeline version >= 1.3'. We want to use 8
	    threads and generate a genome BAM file:
	
	     rsem-calculate-expression --phred64-quals \
	                               -p 8 \
	                               --output-genome-bam \
	                               /data/mmliver.fq \
	                               /ref/mouse_125 \
	                               mmliver_single_quals
	
	    2) '/data/mmliver_1.fq' and '/data/mmliver_2.fq', paired-end reads with
	    quality scores. Quality scores are in SANGER format. We want to use 8
	    threads and do not generate a genome BAM file:
	
	     rsem-calculate-expression -p 8 \
	                               --paired-end \
	                               /data/mmliver_1.fq \
	                               /data/mmliver_2.fq \
	                               /ref/mouse_125 \
	                               mmliver_paired_end_quals
	
	    3) '/data/mmliver.fa', single-end reads without quality scores. We want
	    to use 8 threads:
	
	     rsem-calculate-expression -p 8 \
	                               --no-qualities \
	                               /data/mmliver.fa \
	                               /ref/mouse_125 \
	                               mmliver_single_without_quals
	
	    4) Data are the same as 1). This time we assume the bowtie executables
	    are under '/sw/bowtie'. We want to take a fragment length distribution
	    into consideration. We set the fragment length mean to 150 and the
	    standard deviation to 35. In addition to a BAM file, we also want to
	    generate credibility intervals. We allow RSEM to use 1GB of memory for
	    CI calculation:
	
	     rsem-calculate-expression --bowtie-path /sw/bowtie \
	                               --phred64-quals \
	                               --fragment-length-mean 150.0 \
	                               --fragment-length-sd 35.0 \
	                               -p 8 \
	                               --output-genome-bam \
	                               --calc-ci \
	                               --ci-memory 1024 \
	                               /data/mmliver.fq \
	                               /ref/mouse_125 \
	                               mmliver_single_quals
	
	    5) '/data/mmliver_paired_end_quals.bam', paired-end reads with quality
	    scores. We want to use 8 threads:
	
	     rsem-calculate-expression --paired-end \
	                               --bam \
	                               -p 8 \
	                               /data/mmliver_paired_end_quals.bam \
	                               /ref/mouse_125 \

	NAME
	    rsem-calculate-expression
	
	SYNOPSIS
	     rsem-calculate-expression [options] upstream_read_file(s) reference_name sample_name 
	     rsem-calculate-expression [options] --paired-end upstream_read_file(s) downstream_read_file(s) reference_name sample_name 
	     rsem-calculate-expression [options] --sam/--bam [--paired-end] input reference_name sample_name
	
	ARGUMENTS
	    upstream_read_files(s)
	        Comma-separated list of files containing single-end reads or
	        upstream reads for paired-end data. By default, these files are
	        assumed to be in FASTQ format. If the --no-qualities option is
	        specified, then FASTA format is expected.
	
	    downstream_read_file(s)
	        Comma-separated list of files containing downstream reads which are
	        paired with the upstream reads. By default, these files are assumed
	        to be in FASTQ format. If the --no-qualities option is specified,
	        then FASTA format is expected.
	
	    input
	        SAM/BAM formatted input file. If "-" is specified for the filename,
	        SAM/BAM input is instead assumed to come from standard input. RSEM
	        requires all alignments of the same read group together. For
	        paired-end reads, RSEM also requires the two mates of any alignment
	        be adjacent. See Description section for how to make input file obey
	        RSEM's requirements.
	
	    reference_name
	        The name of the reference used. The user must have run
	        'rsem-prepare-reference' with this reference_name before running
	        this program.
	
	    sample_name
	        The name of the sample analyzed. All output files are prefixed by
	        this name (e.g., sample_name.genes.results)
	
	BASIC OPTIONS
	    --paired-end
	        Input reads are paired-end reads. (Default: off)
	
	    --no-qualities
	        Input reads do not contain quality scores. (Default: off)
	
	    --strand-specific
	        The RNA-Seq protocol used to generate the reads is strand specific,
	        i.e., all (upstream) reads are derived from the forward strand. This
	        option is equivalent to --forward-prob=1.0. With this option set, if
	        RSEM runs the Bowtie/Bowtie 2 aligner, the '--norc' Bowtie/Bowtie 2
	        option will be used, which disables alignment to the reverse strand
	        of transcripts. (Default: off)
	
	    --bowtie2
	        Use Bowtie 2 instead of Bowtie to align reads. Since currently RSEM
	        does not handle indel, local and discordant alignments, the Bowtie2
	        parameters are set in a way to avoid those alignments. In
	        particular, we use options '--sensitive --dpad 0 --gbar 99999999
	        --mp 1,1 --np 1 --score-min L,0,-0.1' by default. The last parameter
	        of '--score-min', '-0.1', is the negative of maximum mismatch rate.
	        This rate can be set by option '--bowtie2-mismatch-rate'. If reads
	        are paired-end, we additionally use options '--no-mixed' and
	        '--no-discordant'. (Default: off)
	
	    --sam
	        Input file is in SAM format. (Default: off)
	
	    --bam
	        Input file is in BAM format. (Default: off)
	
	    -p/--num-threads <int>
	        Number of threads to use. Both Bowtie/Bowtie2, expression estimation
	        and 'samtools sort' will use this many threads. (Default: 1)
	
	    --no-bam-output
	        Do not output any BAM file. (Default: off)
	
	    --output-genome-bam
	        Generate a BAM file, 'sample_name.genome.bam', with alignments
	        mapped to genomic coordinates and annotated with their posterior
	        probabilities. In addition, RSEM will call samtools (included in
	        RSEM package) to sort and index the bam file.
	        'sample_name.genome.sorted.bam' and
	        'sample_name.genome.sorted.bam.bai' will be generated. (Default:
	        off)
	
	    --sampling-for-bam
	        When RSEM generates a BAM file, instead of outputing all alignments
	        a read has with their posterior probabilities, one alignment is
	        sampled according to the posterior probabilities. The sampling
	        procedure includes the alignment to the "noise" transcript, which
	        does not appear in the BAM file. Only the sampled alignment has a
	        weight of 1. All other alignments have weight 0. If the "noise"
	        transcript is sampled, all alignments appeared in the BAM file
	        should have weight 0. (Default: off)
	
	    --seed <uint32>
	        Set the seed for the random number generators used in calculating
	        posterior mean estimates and credibility intervals. The seed must be
	        a non-negative 32 bit interger. (Default: off)
	
	    --calc-pme
	        Run RSEM's collapsed Gibbs sampler to calculate posterior mean
	        estimates. (Default: off)
	
	    --calc-ci
	        Calculate 95% credibility intervals and posterior mean estimates.
	        The credibility level can be changed by setting
	        '--ci-credibility-level'. (Default: off)
	
	    -q/--quiet
	        Suppress the output of logging information. (Default: off)
	
	    -h/--help
	        Show help information.
	
	    --version
	        Show version information.
	
	ADVANCED OPTIONS
	    --sam-header-info <file>
	        RSEM reads header information from input by default. If this option
	        is on, header information is read from the specified file. For the
	        format of the file, please see SAM official website. (Default: "")
	
	    --seed-length <int>
	        Seed length used by the read aligner. Providing the correct value is
	        important for RSEM. If RSEM runs Bowtie, it uses this value for
	        Bowtie's seed length parameter. Any read with its or at least one of
	        its mates' (for paired-end reads) length less than this value will
	        be ignored. If the references are not added poly(A) tails, the
	        minimum allowed value is 5, otherwise, the minimum allowed value is
	        25. Note that this script will only check if the value >= 5 and give
	        a warning message if the value < 25 but >= 5. (Default: 25)
	
	    --tag <string>
	        The name of the optional field used in the SAM input for identifying
	        a read with too many valid alignments. The field should have the
	        format <tagName>:i:<value>, where a <value> bigger than 0 indicates
	        a read with too many alignments. (Default: "")
	
	    --bowtie-path <path>
	        The path to the Bowtie executables. (Default: the path to the Bowtie
	        executables is assumed to be in the user's PATH environment
	        variable)
	
	    --bowtie-n <int>
	        (Bowtie parameter) max # of mismatches in the seed. (Range: 0-3,
	        Default: 2)
	
	    --bowtie-e <int>
	        (Bowtie parameter) max sum of mismatch quality scores across the
	        alignment. (Default: 99999999)
	
	    --bowtie-m <int>
	        (Bowtie parameter) suppress all alignments for a read if > <int>
	        valid alignments exist. (Default: 200)
	
	    --bowtie-chunkmbs <int>
	        (Bowtie parameter) memory allocated for best first alignment
	        calculation (Default: 0 - use Bowtie's default)
	
	    --phred33-quals
	        Input quality scores are encoded as Phred+33. (Default: on)
	
	    --phred64-quals
	        Input quality scores are encoded as Phred+64 (default for GA
	        Pipeline ver. >= 1.3). (Default: off)
	
	    --solexa-quals
	        Input quality scores are solexa encoded (from GA Pipeline ver. <
	        1.3). (Default: off)
	
	    --bowtie2-path <path>
	        (Bowtie 2 parameter) The path to the Bowtie 2 executables. (Default:
	        the path to the Bowtie 2 executables is assumed to be in the user's
	        PATH environment variable)
	
	    --bowtie2-mismatch-rate <double>
	        (Bowtie 2 parameter) The maximum mismatch rate allowed. (Default:
	        0.1)
	
	    --bowtie2-k <int>
	        (Bowtie 2 parameter) Find up to <int> alignments per read. (Default:
	        200)
	
	    --bowtie2-sensitivity-level <string>
	        (Bowtie 2 parameter) Set Bowtie 2's preset options in --end-to-end
	        mode. This option controls how hard Bowtie 2 tries to find
	        alignments. <string> must be one of "very_fast", "fast", "sensitive"
	        and "very_sensitive". The four candidates correspond to Bowtie 2's
	        "--very-fast", "--fast", "--sensitive" and "--very-sensitive"
	        options. (Default: "sensitive" - use Bowtie 2's default)
	
	    --forward-prob <double>
	        Probability of generating a read from the forward strand of a
	        transcript. Set to 1 for a strand-specific protocol where all
	        (upstream) reads are derived from the forward strand, 0 for a
	        strand-specific protocol where all (upstream) read are derived from
	        the reverse strand, or 0.5 for a non-strand-specific protocol.
	        (Default: 0.5)
	
	    --fragment-length-min <int>
	        Minimum read/insert length allowed. This is also the value for the
	        Bowtie/Bowtie2 -I option. (Default: 1)
	
	    --fragment-length-max <int>
	        Maximum read/insert length allowed. This is also the value for the
	        Bowtie/Bowtie 2 -X option. (Default: 1000)
	
	    --fragment-length-mean <double>
	        (single-end data only) The mean of the fragment length distribution,
	        which is assumed to be a Gaussian. (Default: -1, which disables use
	        of the fragment length distribution)
	
	    --fragment-length-sd <double>
	        (single-end data only) The standard deviation of the fragment length
	        distribution, which is assumed to be a Gaussian. (Default: 0, which
	        assumes that all fragments are of the same length, given by the
	        rounded value of --fragment-length-mean)
	
	    --estimate-rspd
	        Set this option if you want to estimate the read start position
	        distribution (RSPD) from data. Otherwise, RSEM will use a uniform
	        RSPD. (Default: off)
	
	    --num-rspd-bins <int>
	        Number of bins in the RSPD. Only relevant when '--estimate-rspd' is
	        specified. Use of the default setting is recommended. (Default: 20)
	
	    --gibbs-burnin <int>
	        The number of burn-in rounds for RSEM's Gibbs sampler. Each round
	        passes over the entire data set once. If RSEM can use multiple
	        threads, multiple Gibbs samplers will start at the same time and all
	        samplers share the same burn-in number. (Default: 200)
	
	    --gibbs-number-of-samples <int>
	        The total number of count vectors RSEM will collect from its Gibbs
	        samplers. (Default: 1000)
	
	    --gibbs-sampling-gap <int>
	        The number of rounds between two succinct count vectors RSEM
	        collects. If the count vector after round N is collected, the count
	        vector after round N + <int> will also be collected. (Default: 1)
	
	    --ci-credibility-level <double>
	        The credibility level for credibility intervals. (Default: 0.95)
	
	    --ci-memory <int>
	        Maximum size (in memory, MB) of the auxiliary buffer used for
	        computing credibility intervals (CI). Set it larger for a faster CI
	        calculation. However, leaving 2 GB memory free for other usage is
	        recommended. (Default: 1024)
	
	    --ci-number-of-samples-per-count-vector <int>
	        The number of read generating probability vectors sampled per
	        sampled count vector. The crebility intervals are calculated by
	        first sampling P(C | D) and then sampling P(Theta | C) for each
	        sampled count vector. This option controls how many Theta vectors
	        are sampled per sampled count vector. (Default: 50)
	
	    --samtools-sort-mem <string>
	        Set the maximum memory per thread that can be used by 'samtools
	        sort'. <string> represents the memory and accepts suffices 'K/M/G'.
	        RSEM will pass <string> to the '-m' option of 'samtools sort'.
	        Please note that the default used here is different from the default
	        used by samtools. (Default: 1G)
	
	    --keep-intermediate-files
	        Keep temporary files generated by RSEM. RSEM creates a temporary
	        directory, 'sample_name.temp', into which it puts all intermediate
	        output files. If this directory already exists, RSEM overwrites all
	        files generated by previous RSEM runs inside of it. By default,
	        after RSEM finishes, the temporary directory is deleted. Set this
	        option to prevent the deletion of this directory and the
	        intermediate files inside of it. (Default: off)
	
	    --temporary-folder <string>
	        Set where to put the temporary files generated by RSEM. If the
	        folder specified does not exist, RSEM will try to create it.
	        (Default: sample_name.temp)
	
	    --time
	        Output time consumed by each step of RSEM to 'sample_name.time'.
	        (Default: off)
	
	DESCRIPTION
	    In its default mode, this program aligns input reads against a reference
	    transcriptome with Bowtie and calculates expression values using the
	    alignments. RSEM assumes the data are single-end reads with quality
	    scores, unless the '--paired-end' or '--no-qualities' options are
	    specified. Users may use an alternative aligner by specifying one of the
	    --sam and --bam options, and providing an alignment file in the
	    specified format. However, users should make sure that they align
	    against the indices generated by 'rsem-prepare-reference' and the
	    alignment file satisfies the requirements mentioned in ARGUMENTS
	    section.
	
	    One simple way to make the alignment file satisfying RSEM's requirements
	    (assuming the aligner used put mates in a paired-end read adjacent) is
	    to use 'convert-sam-for-rsem' script. This script only accept SAM format
	    files as input. If a BAM format file is obtained, please use samtools to
	    convert it to a SAM file first. For example, if '/ref/mouse_125' is the
	    'reference_name' and the SAM file is named 'input.sam', you can run the
	    following command:
	
	      convert-sam-for-rsem /ref/mouse_125 input.sam -o input_for_rsem.sam
	
	    For details, please refer to 'convert-sam-for-rsem's documentation page.
	
	    The SAM/BAM format RSEM uses is v1.4. However, it is compatible with old
	    SAM/BAM format. However, RSEM cannot recognize 0x100 in the FLAG field.
	    In addition, RSEM requires SEQ and QUAL are not '*'.
	
	    The user must run 'rsem-prepare-reference' with the appropriate
	    reference before using this program.
	
	    For single-end data, it is strongly recommended that the user provide
	    the fragment length distribution parameters (--fragment-length-mean and
	    --fragment-length-sd). For paired-end data, RSEM will automatically
	    learn a fragment length distribution from the data.
	
	    Please note that some of the default values for the Bowtie parameters
	    are not the same as those defined for Bowtie itself.
	
	    The temporary directory and all intermediate files will be removed when
	    RSEM finishes unless '--keep-intermediate-files' is specified.
	
	    With the '--calc-pme' option, posterior mean estimates will be
	    calculated in addition to maximum likelihood estimates.
	
	    With the '--calc-ci' option, 95% credibility intervals and posterior
	    mean estimates will be calculated in addition to maximum likelihood
	    estimates.
	
	OUTPUT
	    sample_name.isoforms.results
	        File containing isoform level expression estimates. The first line
	        contains column names separated by the tab character. The format of

	        Fields are separated by the tab character. Fields within "[]" are
	        optional. They will not be presented if neither '--calc-pme' nor
	        '--calc-ci' is set.
	
	        'transcript_id' is the transcript name of this transcript. 'gene_id'
	        is the gene name of the gene which this transcript belongs to
	        (denote this gene as its parent gene). If no gene information is
	        provided, 'gene_id' and 'transcript_id' are the same.
	
	        'length' is this transcript's sequence length (poly(A) tail is not
	        counted). 'effective_length' counts only the positions that can
	        generate a valid fragment. If no poly(A) tail is added,
	        'effective_length' is equal to transcript length - mean fragment
	        length + 1. If one transcript's effective length is less than 1,
	        this transcript's both effective length and abundance estimates are
	        set to 0.
	
	        'expected_count' is the sum of the posterior probability of each
	        read comes from this transcript over all reads. Because 1) each read
	        aligning to this transcript has a probability of being generated
	        from background noise; 2) RSEM may filter some alignable low quality
	        reads, the sum of expected counts for all transcript are generally
	        less than the total number of reads aligned.
	
	        'TPM' stands for Transcripts Per Million. It is a relative measure
	        of transcript abundance. The sum of all transcripts' TPM is 1
	        million. 'FPKM' stands for Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per
	        Million mapped reads. It is another relative measure of transcript
	        abundance. If we define l_bar be the mean transcript length in a
	        sample, which can be calculated as
	
	        l_bar = \sum_i TPM_i / 10^6 * effective_length_i (i goes through
	        every transcript),
	
	        the following equation is hold:
	
	        FPKM_i = 10^3 / l_bar * TPM_i.
	
	        We can see that the sum of FPKM is not a constant across samples.
	
	        'IsoPct' stands for isoform percentage. It is the percentage of this
	        transcript's abandunce over its parent gene's abandunce. If its
	        parent gene has only one isoform or the gene information is not
	        provided, this field will be set to 100.
	
	        'posterior_mean_count', 'pme_TPM', 'pme_FPKM' are posterior mean
	        estimates calculated by RSEM's Gibbs sampler.
	        'posterior_standard_deviation_of_count' is the posterior standard
	        deviation of counts. 'IsoPct_from_pme_TPM' is the isoform percentage
	        calculated from 'pme_TPM' values.
	
	        'TPM_ci_lower_bound', 'TPM_ci_upper_bound', 'FPKM_ci_lower_bound'
	        and 'FPKM_ci_upper_bound' are lower(l) and upper(u) bounds of 95%
	        credibility intervals for TPM and FPKM values. The bounds are
	        inclusive (i.e. [l, u]).
	
	    sample_name.genes.results
	        File containing gene level expression estimates. The first line
	        contains column names separated by the tab character. The format of
	        each line in the rest of this file is:
	
	        gene_id transcript_id(s) length effective_length expected_count TPM
	        FPKM [posterior_mean_count posterior_standard_deviation_of_count
	        pme_TPM pme_FPKM TPM_ci_lower_bound TPM_ci_upper_bound
	        FPKM_ci_lower_bound FPKM_ci_upper_bound]
	
	        Fields are separated by the tab character. Fields within "[]" are
	        optional. They will not be presented if neither '--calc-pme' nor
	        '--calc-ci' is set.
	
	        'transcript_id(s)' is a comma-separated list of transcript_ids
	        belonging to this gene. If no gene information is provided,
	        'gene_id' and 'transcript_id(s)' are identical (the
	        'transcript_id').
	
	        A gene's 'length' and 'effective_length' are defined as the weighted
	        average of its transcripts' lengths and effective lengths (weighted
	        by 'IsoPct'). A gene's abundance estimates are just the sum of its
	        transcripts' abundance estimates.
	
	    sample_name.alleles.results
	        Only generated when the RSEM references are built with
	        allele-specific transcripts.
	
	        This file contains allele level expression estimates for
	        allele-specific expression calculation. The first line contains
	        column names separated by the tab character. The format of each line
	        in the rest of this file is:
	
	        allele_id transcript_id gene_id length effective_length
	        expected_count TPM FPKM AlleleIsoPct AlleleGenePct
	        [posterior_mean_count posterior_standard_deviation_of_count pme_TPM

	        TPM_ci_lower_bound TPM_ci_upper_bound FPKM_ci_lower_bound
	        FPKM_ci_upper_bound]
	
	        Fields are separated by the tab character. Fields within "[]" are
	        optional. They will not be presented if neither '--calc-pme' nor
	        '--calc-ci' is set.
	
	        'allele_id' is the allele-specific name of this allele-specific
	        transcript.
	
	        'AlleleIsoPct' stands for allele-specific percentage on isoform
	        level. It is the percentage of this allele-specific transcript's
	        abundance over its parent transcript's abundance. If its parent
	        transcript has only one allele variant form, this field will be set
	        to 100.
	
	        'AlleleGenePct' stands for allele-specific percentage on gene level.
	        It is the percentage of this allele-specific transcript's abundance
	        over its parent gene's abundance.
	
	        'AlleleIsoPct_from_pme_TPM' and 'AlleleGenePct_from_pme_TPM' have
	        similar meanings. They are calculated based on posterior mean
	        estimates.
	
	        Please note that if this file is present, the fields 'length' and
	        'effective_length' in 'sample_name.isoforms.results' should be
	        interpreted similarly as the corresponding definitions in
	        'sample_name.genes.results'.
	
	    sample_name.transcript.bam, sample_name.transcript.sorted.bam and
	    sample_name.transcript.sorted.bam.bai
	        Only generated when --no-bam-output is not specified.
	
	        'sample_name.transcript.bam' is a BAM-formatted file of read
	        alignments in transcript coordinates. The MAPQ field of each
	        alignment is set to min(100, floor(-10 * log10(1.0 - w) + 0.5)),
	        where w is the posterior probability of that alignment being the
	        true mapping of a read. In addition, RSEM pads a new tag ZW:f:value,
	        where value is a single precision floating number representing the
	        posterior probability. Because this file contains all alignment
	        lines produced by bowtie or user-specified aligners, it can also be
	        used as a replacement of the aligner generated BAM/SAM file. For
	        paired-end reads, if one mate has alignments but the other does not,
	        this file marks the alignable mate as "unmappable" (flag bit 0x4)
	        and appends an optional field "Z0:A:!".
	
	        'sample_name.transcript.sorted.bam' and
	        'sample_name.transcript.sorted.bam.bai' are the sorted BAM file and
	        indices generated by samtools (included in RSEM package).
	
	    sample_name.genome.bam, sample_name.genome.sorted.bam and
	    sample_name.genome.sorted.bam.bai
	        Only generated when --no-bam-output is not specified and
	        --output-genome-bam is specified.
	
	        'sample_name.genome.bam' is a BAM-formatted file of read alignments
	        in genomic coordinates. Alignments of reads that have identical
	        genomic coordinates (i.e., alignments to different isoforms that
	        share the same genomic region) are collapsed into one alignment. The
	        MAPQ field of each alignment is set to min(100, floor(-10 *
	        log10(1.0 - w) + 0.5)), where w is the posterior probability of that
	        alignment being the true mapping of a read. In addition, RSEM pads a
	        new tag ZW:f:value, where value is a single precision floating
	        number representing the posterior probability. If an alignment is
	        spliced, a XS:A:value tag is also added, where value is either '+'
	        or '-' indicating the strand of the transcript it aligns to.
	
	        'sample_name.genome.sorted.bam' and
	        'sample_name.genome.sorted.bam.bai' are the sorted BAM file and
	        indices generated by samtools (included in RSEM package).
	
	    sample_name.time
	        Only generated when --time is specified.
	
	        It contains time (in seconds) consumed by aligning reads, estimating
	        expression levels and calculating credibility intervals.
	
	    sample_name.stat
	        This is a folder instead of a file. All model related statistics are
	        stored in this folder. Use 'rsem-plot-model' can generate plots
	        using this folder.
	
	        'sample_name.stat/sample_name.cnt' contains alignment statistics.
	        The format and meanings of each field are described in
	        'cnt_file_description.txt' under RSEM directory.
	
	        'sample_name.stat/sample_name.model' stores RNA-Seq model parameters
	        learned from the data. The format and meanings of each filed of this
	        file are described in 'model_file_description.txt' under RSEM
	        directory.
	
	EXAMPLES
	    Assume the path to the bowtie executables is in the user's PATH
	    environment variable. Reference files are under '/ref' with name
	    'mouse_125'.
	
	    1) '/data/mmliver.fq', single-end reads with quality scores. Quality
	    scores are encoded as for 'GA pipeline version >= 1.3'. We want to use 8
	    threads and generate a genome BAM file:
	
	     rsem-calculate-expression --phred64-quals \
	                               -p 8 \
	                               --output-genome-bam \
	                               /data/mmliver.fq \
	                               /ref/mouse_125 \
	                               mmliver_single_quals
	
	    2) '/data/mmliver_1.fq' and '/data/mmliver_2.fq', paired-end reads with
	    quality scores. Quality scores are in SANGER format. We want to use 8
	    threads and do not generate a genome BAM file:
	
	     rsem-calculate-expression -p 8 \
	                               --paired-end \
	                               /data/mmliver_1.fq \
	                               /data/mmliver_2.fq \
	                               /ref/mouse_125 \
	                               mmliver_paired_end_quals
	
	    3) '/data/mmliver.fa', single-end reads without quality scores. We want
	    to use 8 threads:
	
	     rsem-calculate-expression -p 8 \
	                               --no-qualities \
	                               /data/mmliver.fa \
	                               /ref/mouse_125 \
	                               mmliver_single_without_quals
	
	    4) Data are the same as 1). This time we assume the bowtie executables
	    are under '/sw/bowtie'. We want to take a fragment length distribution
	    into consideration. We set the fragment length mean to 150 and the
	    standard deviation to 35. In addition to a BAM file, we also want to
	    generate credibility intervals. We allow RSEM to use 1GB of memory for
	    CI calculation:
	
	     rsem-calculate-expression --bowtie-path /sw/bowtie \
	                               --phred64-quals \
	                               --fragment-length-mean 150.0 \
	                               --fragment-length-sd 35.0 \
	                               -p 8 \
	                               --output-genome-bam \
	                               --calc-ci \
	                               --ci-memory 1024 \
	                               /data/mmliver.fq \
	                               /ref/mouse_125 \
	                               mmliver_single_quals
	
	    5) '/data/mmliver_paired_end_quals.bam', paired-end reads with quality
	    scores. We want to use 8 threads:
	
	     rsem-calculate-expression --paired-end \
	                               --bam \
	                               -p 8 \
	                               /data/mmliver_paired_end_quals.bam \
	                               /ref/mouse_125 \
